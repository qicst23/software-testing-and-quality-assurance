Our group (Ning Xu and Yayang Tian) have paid great effort into this project. Frankly speaking, it is really really time-consuming. We 've spent about 7 full days, day after day, night after night, to overcome dozens of problems that occured. However tough this project seems to be, it worth it! We've laid a solid foundation of software testing using Eclipse JAVA, JUnit and muJava! We've reviewed the concepts like test case generation and adequacy criteria in class! We're happy!  Thank you very much!   : )
